Thank you for visiting my site. This blog was created to document my odyssey towards learning computer programming. By working on several projects and showcasing those projects here, I hope to solidify my knowledge and demonstrate my aptitude. My first project was building this site. This site was created using a serverless framework. By utilizing Hexo https://hexo.io I was able to design and generate static HTML files which were uploaded to AWS S3. The domain for this site was registered via AWS route 53. I then utilized AWS CDN to create a CloudFront distribution and connected it to the S3 bucket to enhance the latency performance of this site. Finally to automate the process of deploying new posts I use a CI/CD pipepline that automatically pushes changes. 

## About Me

{% blockquote Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.32%}
"You have to assemble your life yourself action by action, and be satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far as it can. No one can keep that from happening. But there will be some external obstacles!...if you accept the obstacle and work with what you're given, an alternative will present itself - another piece of what you're trying to assemble. Action by action."

I grew up in the sunshine state. Miami is home. My blood is Punjabi. I'm a descendant from the Dogar Tribe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogar. I attended Florida State University and earned my Bachelors in Chemical Science. I also have a Masters in Biomedical Science from Barry University. Initially, I had aspirations to become a doctor. But due to various factors and circumstances, I realized my future path wasnâ€™t intended for medicine and so I switched fields. Since January of 2018, I started learning programming and taught myself python. I then moved on towards learning and working with cloud-based technology. I am a strong believer in stoic principles. The quote above by Marcus Aurelius defines my transition from medicine to computer science. Despite the setbacks, my life purpose is still the same, to help society and improve the lives of others. Hopefully by learning and increasing my knowledge in computer science, I can be more effective in this pursuit.
